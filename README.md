<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
This project is being graded as a final year project for the course of Computer Science and Information Technology in the
National University of Ireland, Galway.

The main goal of this project is to create a web application
which reads netflow data from the current server and to display it for monitoring purposes.
The intended users of this web application are network administrators who wish to gain a general overview of which network users
are using which web services and to also monitor potentially malicious network activity.

The app is currently being tested while using softflowd as a network probe and using nfdump to generate aggregations of network connections.
